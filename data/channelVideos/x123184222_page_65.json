It killed seven children, including all five of Buthaina'a brothers and sisters.\r\nEight other children were wounded, including two-year old Sam Bassem Al-Hamdani, whose parents were killed in the attack.\r\nAmnesty's report outlines how the evidence was collected:\r\n\"After examining photographic evidence provided by a local journalist who dug out the remaining fragments of the weapon at the site, Amnesty International's arms expert was able to positively identify the data plate from a US-made MAU-169L\/B computer control group. It is a part used in several types of laser-guided air-dropped bombs.\"\r\nAl-Haddad is appreciative of what he perceives to be the pressure exerted upon government by the US citizens. \r\n\"American people and American organisations should be thanked for the pressure they've placed every day and every hour on the US and the Senate and Congress, it proves the point is valid,\" he says.\r\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia has threatened other countries over a proposed resolution at the UN's leading human rights body that would send international, independent investigators into Yemen.\r\nA Saudi letter obtained by The Associated Press shows the kingdom has warned that adoption of the proposal by Canada and the Netherlands at the Human Rights Council could \"negatively affect\" their trade and diplomatic ties with the rich, influential kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/789f30111fdd19e829cfa47e1e72315c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(26 Sep 2017) LEADIN:\r\nCivil servants in Lebanon have gone on strike in a row over wages.\r\nThe government is struggling to fund a recently agreed pay rise. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nHundreds of civil servants crowd the streets outside the Prime Minister's office.\r\nThey are on strike to pressure the government to pay them recently approved wage hikes amid a new crisis over how to finance them.\r\nThe police are out in force- many in riot gear - in case of trouble at the demonstration.\r\nHanna Gharib, Head of Lebanese Communist Party, says the protests must \"escalated\".\r\n\"People should go on the streets not only for the pay raise and the taxes but for the entire social and economic issues in the country,\" he says.\r\nHe lists education, medication, electricity and water issues as the major problems.\r\nTeachers hold signs aloft demanding to be \"happy again\".\r\nHoda Ghazi says those in the profession are no longer able to \"live with dignity\". \r\nShe says salaries are so low that teachers are not able to educate their students.\r\nThe strike has left classrooms empty.\r\nBut the Cabinet has convened to discuss the ways to finance the new wages.\r\nThe bill is estimated to be 800 million US dollars. \r\nThe law improving the wages, which had been in the works for years, was passed earlier this summer. \r\nBut the Constitutional Council earlier this week revoked a tax law to finance the bill, saying it violated the constitution.\r\nThe decision left the government scrambling for ways to finance the wage bill, amid pressure from public servants who expected their new salaries this month.\r\nMelhem Riyashi, the Lebanese Information Minister, says the law has been discussed \"in depth\" today.\r\n\"The discussion is not over and will be continued on Thursday in a session at the Presidency Palace headed by the president,             hoping that the law will be approved by the parliament,\" he continues.\r\nSo it will be at least two more days before civil servants can be confident of an increase in their pay packets.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/667fe91282600dc23cd81ca44858eee5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

It killed seven children, including all five of Buthaina'a brothers and sisters.\r\nEight other children were wounded, including two-year old Sam Bassem Al-Hamdani, whose parents were killed in the attack.\r\nAmnesty's report outlines how the evidence was collected:\r\n\"After examining photographic evidence provided by a local journalist who dug out the remaining fragments of the weapon at the site, Amnesty International's arms expert was able to positively identify the data plate from a US-made MAU-169L\/B computer control group. It is a part used in several types of laser-guided air-dropped bombs.\"\r\nAl-Haddad is appreciative of what he perceives to be the pressure exerted upon government by the US citizens. \r\n\"American people and American organisations should be thanked for the pressure they've placed every day and every hour on the US and the Senate and Congress, it proves the point is valid,\" he says.\r\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia has threatened other countries over a proposed resolution at the UN's leading human rights body that would send international, independent investigators into Yemen.\r\nA Saudi letter obtained by The Associated Press shows the kingdom has warned that adoption of the proposal by Canada and the Netherlands at the Human Rights Council could \"negatively affect\" their trade and diplomatic ties with the rich, influential kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/789f30111fdd19e829cfa47e1e72315c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
