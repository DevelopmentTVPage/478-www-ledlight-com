For me, the damage done was beyond the moral, it wasn't really just material.\"\r\nHe adds: \"I believe that even if there is a reparations payment, it shouldn't go to individuals.

The militants were driven out after nearly a year by French forces, and those troops arrested Al Mahdi in neighbouring Niger in 2014.\r\nThe ICC said the destruction of cultural monuments like those in Timbuktu: \"carries a message of terror and helplessness. (It) destroys part of humanity's shared memory and collective consciousness, and renders humanity unable to transmit its values and knowledge to future generations.\"\r\nAt previous hearings, Al Mahdi pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for his role in leading the destruction, urged Muslims around the world not to commit similar acts and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\r\nAl Boukhari en Essayouti, director of Timbuktu Cultural Mission, says hearing his remorse was \"a relief\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/82fa58f3e7fe29360d890a2d8d92fb5f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

We have celebrated the wedding with our own costumes, well-known in Taiz, and the usual dances known to the community which have been missed in the past,\" says bridegroom Abdul Nasser Al-Siddiq.\r\nAt this ceremony in At Turbah, south of Taiz, guests both young and old dance to folk music and dress in a traditional Yemeni style.\r\nYounger generations have been learning popular folk dances to entertain their fellow guests.\r\nDirector of Taiz's Culture Office, Abdul Khalek Saif, says that many people are reviving their heritage through their wedding celebrations.\r\n\"We sing with the voice of Taiz, with its heritage, with its hats and its own costume. This is the city of Taiz, the city of life, the city of beauty, the heritage city, it will never be a city of death.\"\r\nHowever, not everyone wants to incorporate the old traditions into their special day.\r\nAt this Taiz wedding, guests partake in the more modern custom of celebratory gunfire before dancing in the streets, late into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ab666d08134a1cc07991ed91d696b06b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(1 Oct 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nThe city of Taiz is the cultural capital of Yemen, with a rich heritage that many residents are keen to preserve.\r\nNow, an increasing number of wedding parties are reviving certain traditions as a way of keeping them alive.\r\n\r\nSTORY-LINE:\r\nDressed in traditional attire and smiling for the camera, these wedding guests are part of a trend sweeping the Yemeni city of Taiz.\r\nThe south-western city is renowned as the cultural capital of Yemen and as such many residents are keen to preserve their heritage.\r\nAnd at this ceremony, the groom has decided to include a number of traditional elements into the day.\r\nFrom traditional costumes to well-known folk music and dancing, the wedding ceremony is a feast of Yemeni culture.\r\nA young man from the city of Taiz decided to restore the heritage of his city to the front of the scene after a long absence, through his wedding ceremony held in traditional rituals in terms of old songs, folk costumes, dancing and ancient heritage holdings.\r\n\"Today I am having my traditional wedding to revive the heritage of Taiz. We have celebrated the wedding with our own costumes, well-known in Taiz, and the usual dances known to the community which have been missed in the past,\" says bridegroom Abdul Nasser Al-Siddiq.\r\nAt this ceremony in At Turbah, south of Taiz, guests both young and old dance to folk music and dress in a traditional Yemeni style.\r\nYounger generations have been learning popular folk dances to entertain their fellow guests.\r\nDirector of Taiz's Culture Office, Abdul Khalek Saif, says that many people are reviving their heritage through their wedding celebrations.\r\n\"We sing with the voice of Taiz, with its heritage, with its hats and its own costume. This is the city of Taiz, the city of life, the city of beauty, the heritage city, it will never be a city of death.\"\r\nHowever, not everyone wants to incorporate the old traditions into their special day.\r\nAt this Taiz wedding, guests partake in the more modern custom of celebratory gunfire before dancing in the streets, late into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ab666d08134a1cc07991ed91d696b06b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

For me, the damage done was beyond the moral, it wasn't really just material.\"\r\nHe adds: \"I believe that even if there is a reparations payment, it shouldn't go to individuals. It should be used to improve the protection of and the restoration of the mausoleums.\"\r\nTimbuktu was famed for the reverence it gave to its saints and tourists once came here for spiritual peace.\r\nBut times have changed. Rubbish is now strewn around the mausoleum of Cheikh Sidi Ahmed Ben Amar. Locals use the site as a dump. \r\nThis started after Al Mahdi and his pickaxe-wielding rebels reduced the mausoleum to rubble, but is still continuing today.\r\n\"Today, what grieves me the most is all this rubbish,\" says mausoleum guardian Mohamed Maouloud.\r\nHe adds that he's been to see people, including the Malian army general Ould Meidou and Timbuktu regional council Ould Hamadi, to see if they can fix the problem.\r\nThe sites that were attacked were built during the 15th and 16th centuries at a time when Timbuktu was considered a great centre of Islamic learning. All but one of them was on the World Heritage list.\r\nThe Netherlands based ICC found that Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi had intentionally directed attacks against nine mausoleums and a mosque door in the desert city in 2012. \r\nProsecutors said Al Mahdi was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamic extremist group with links to al-Qaida which held power in northern Mali at the time. The militants were driven out after nearly a year by French forces, and those troops arrested Al Mahdi in neighbouring Niger in 2014.\r\nThe ICC said the destruction of cultural monuments like those in Timbuktu: \"carries a message of terror and helplessness. (It) destroys part of humanity's shared memory and collective consciousness, and renders humanity unable to transmit its values and knowledge to future generations.\"\r\nAt previous hearings, Al Mahdi pleaded guilty and expressed remorse for his role in leading the destruction, urged Muslims around the world not to commit similar acts and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\r\nAl Boukhari en Essayouti, director of Timbuktu Cultural Mission, says hearing his remorse was \"a relief\".\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/82fa58f3e7fe29360d890a2d8d92fb5f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
