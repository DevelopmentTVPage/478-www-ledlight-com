Price. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFar from Frieze art fair's frantic booths and packed hallways, towering artworks are invading London's autumnal Regents Park.\r\nThe art fair's annual Frieze Sculpture, claimed to be London's largest outdoor exhibition, is showcasing 24 artists.\r\nOne highlight is this towering metallic giant by late Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi.

She says it's very different to curating a traditional exhibit.\r\n\"I'm looking for really high-quality sculpture, I'm looking for sculpture that is of interest to major international collectors, but I'm also looking to make an exhibition that is very accessible to a very, very diverse public,\" she says. \r\n\"Because this is a very public park, it's an incredibly busy park, you have people coming here for lunch, you have people coming here with their babies, exercising, people have parties here.\"\r\nAnd since they're not nailed to gallery walls, the artworks can be explored, viewed and interacted with in new and exciting ways.\r\nVisitors can gaze skywards at this upturned elephant by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo or perhaps become hynotised by this swinging hammock by US artist Sarah Sze.\r\n\"So, the wonderful thing about sculptures is even though they're static, we enable them to move and it's an immersive all encompassing, all sensory experience,\" says art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"Because we move around the sculpture and as we move around it looks different from every angle.\"\r\nOne highlight is this towering seven-metre tall sculpture by US artist KAWS. \r\nNamed 'FINAL DAYS', it exhibits the artist's unique toy-like style, while at the same time appearing monstrous and domineering.\r\nKAWS is a popular choice for social media fans. He boasts almost 900,000 followers on picture-sharing app Instagram. Over 500,000 more than Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, for instance.\r\n\"He started work as a street artist, he works with designers, he makes clothing ranges, he has this incredible reach, an enormous, enormously diverse audience and he kind of has a cult following,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"That isn't necessarily important, but what it means is the work is extremely accessible to a very wide public and that's really, really important for people coming into the space, that they have something that can catch hold of, that they can understand, that there's an immediacy.\"\r\nBritish artist Thomas J. Price is showcasing this recent three-part work, named 'Numen (Shifting Votive One, Two and Three)'.\r\nCast in grey aluminium and set on marble plinths, they're intended to resemble commemorative busts.\r\n\"He's dealing with issues which I think are very important within our society, specifically here, the non-representation of black people in the public realm as sculptures, as statues,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"But he's brought his very contemporary bearing to these works, he's cast them in aluminium, which just physically because of the colour of the aluminium, makes them very startling.\"\r\nJapanese artist Takuro Kuwata is showcasing these towering 'tree' sculptures' formed from porcelain, stone, glaze, pigment, steel, gold and laquer.\r\nKuwata often transforms traditional Japanese pottery techniques to create bright, ambitious ceramic works.\r\n\"I think the wonderful thing about having sculptures outside in the park is that it engages with people that are perhaps too afraid to go into a gallery space,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/04470bafa821357c3db7bf7d331c58c7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

They seem to balance the bacteria in the gut and there are so many things that animals do and animals eat - medications that we as veterinarians give these patients that could upset that balance, inflammatory conditions, inflammatory bowel disease for example, any time of infiltrative disease can also affect the gut flora and upset that balance and therefore we see problems like diarrhoea\" says Werber.\r\nAt Pussy &amp; Pooch Pet Lifestyle Center in Beverly Hills, pet nutrition is part of the overall package of wellness, retail, grooming, day care, training and boarding services.\r\nCompany founder Janene Zakrajsek says: \"I think when it comes to probiotics anything that is considered a functional product i.e. functional treats. is a lot easier for consumers to wrap their heads around because it's a lot easier so they are not necessarily thinking it as an alternative to medicine, they're thinking it as something natural that they can do as a supplement, but by packaging it as something functional where it's combined with a treat or a chewable tablet or like a frozen yogurt or a goat milk these are ways of incorporating something that is healthy and beneficial in an easy way.\"\r\nStaff here curate their own probiotics.\r\nHollywood's Healthy Spot, an organic pet food and dog day care centre has pet probiotics on many of its shelves.\r\nHere, employees also see daily probiotic preparation no longer a problem.\r\nIts spokesperson Jade Lorain says there are too many processed pet foods marketing themselves as being healthy, but she believes the best foods are raw or mixed on the spot.\r\n\"The probiotics keep the bad bacteria from taking over their pets digestive system along with the enzymes that breakdown the food. We carry different products such as raw goats milk that have all 30 enzymes needed for digestive systems that you just defrost and pour into their daily routine with their food, along with tripe toppers that are little treats that you add into the food that are filled with probiotics and enzymes,\" says Lorain.\r\nHowever, Dr. Werber says not all probiotics are the same.\r\nHe believes some products which carry health claims on their label are adding substandard probiotics to their pet food lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8ba75866829dbc5268231c915fe2a0f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

They seem to balance the bacteria in the gut and there are so many things that animals do and animals eat - medications that we as veterinarians give these patients that could upset that balance, inflammatory conditions, inflammatory bowel disease for example, any time of infiltrative disease can also affect the gut flora and upset that balance and therefore we see problems like diarrhoea\" says Werber.\r\nAt Pussy &amp; Pooch Pet Lifestyle Center in Beverly Hills, pet nutrition is part of the overall package of wellness, retail, grooming, day care, training and boarding services.\r\nCompany founder Janene Zakrajsek says: \"I think when it comes to probiotics anything that is considered a functional product i.e. functional treats. is a lot easier for consumers to wrap their heads around because it's a lot easier so they are not necessarily thinking it as an alternative to medicine, they're thinking it as something natural that they can do as a supplement, but by packaging it as something functional where it's combined with a treat or a chewable tablet or like a frozen yogurt or a goat milk these are ways of incorporating something that is healthy and beneficial in an easy way.\"\r\nStaff here curate their own probiotics.\r\nHollywood's Healthy Spot, an organic pet food and dog day care centre has pet probiotics on many of its shelves.\r\nHere, employees also see daily probiotic preparation no longer a problem.\r\nIts spokesperson Jade Lorain says there are too many processed pet foods marketing themselves as being healthy, but she believes the best foods are raw or mixed on the spot.\r\n\"The probiotics keep the bad bacteria from taking over their pets digestive system along with the enzymes that breakdown the food. We carry different products such as raw goats milk that have all 30 enzymes needed for digestive systems that you just defrost and pour into their daily routine with their food, along with tripe toppers that are little treats that you add into the food that are filled with probiotics and enzymes,\" says Lorain.\r\nHowever, Dr. Werber says not all probiotics are the same.\r\nHe believes some products which carry health claims on their label are adding substandard probiotics to their pet food lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8ba75866829dbc5268231c915fe2a0f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
