            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nOne of London's best-known parks is playing host to a wide variety of sculptures by the likes of Eduardo Paolozzi and the cult American artist known as KAWS. \r\nThere's also a strong statement on racial inclusion from British artist Thomas J. Price. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFar from Frieze art fair's frantic booths and packed hallways, towering artworks are invading London's autumnal Regents Park.\r\nThe art fair's annual Frieze Sculpture, claimed to be London's largest outdoor exhibition, is showcasing 24 artists.\r\nOne highlight is this towering metallic giant by late Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Made in 1999, it was one of Paolozzi's last monumental commissions.\r\nThe sculpture park was curated by Claire Lilley, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park. She says it's very different to curating a traditional exhibit.\r\n\"I'm looking for really high-quality sculpture, I'm looking for sculpture that is of interest to major international collectors, but I'm also looking to make an exhibition that is very accessible to a very, very diverse public,\" she says. \r\n\"Because this is a very public park, it's an incredibly busy park, you have people coming here for lunch, you have people coming here with their babies, exercising, people have parties here.\"\r\nAnd since they're not nailed to gallery walls, the artworks can be explored, viewed and interacted with in new and exciting ways.\r\nVisitors can gaze skywards at this upturned elephant by Spanish artist Miquel Barcelo or perhaps become hynotised by this swinging hammock by US artist Sarah Sze.\r\n\"So, the wonderful thing about sculptures is even though they're static, we enable them to move and it's an immersive all encompassing, all sensory experience,\" says art critic Estelle Lovatt.\r\n\"Because we move around the sculpture and as we move around it looks different from every angle.\"\r\nOne highlight is this towering seven-metre tall sculpture by US artist KAWS. \r\nNamed 'FINAL DAYS', it exhibits the artist's unique toy-like style, while at the same time appearing monstrous and domineering.\r\nKAWS is a popular choice for social media fans. He boasts almost 900,000 followers on picture-sharing app Instagram. Over 500,000 more than Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, for instance.\r\n\"He started work as a street artist, he works with designers, he makes clothing ranges, he has this incredible reach, an enormous, enormously diverse audience and he kind of has a cult following,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"That isn't necessarily important, but what it means is the work is extremely accessible to a very wide public and that's really, really important for people coming into the space, that they have something that can catch hold of, that they can understand, that there's an immediacy.\"\r\nBritish artist Thomas J. Price is showcasing this recent three-part work, named 'Numen (Shifting Votive One, Two and Three)'.\r\nCast in grey aluminium and set on marble plinths, they're intended to resemble commemorative busts.\r\n\"He's dealing with issues which I think are very important within our society, specifically here, the non-representation of black people in the public realm as sculptures, as statues,\" says Lilley.\r\n\"But he's brought his very contemporary bearing to these works, he's cast them in aluminium, which just physically because of the colour of the aluminium, makes them very startling.\"\r\nJapanese artist Takuro Kuwata is showcasing these towering 'tree' sculptures' formed from porcelain, stone, glaze, pigment, steel, gold and laquer.\r\nKuwata often transforms traditional Japanese pottery techniques to create bright, ambitious ceramic works.\r\n\"I think the wonderful thing about having sculptures outside in the park is that it engages with people that are perhaps too afraid to go into a gallery space,\" says Lovatt.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/fa46648b3281cc5121d6d30a71bf43bf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Ed Royce, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described it as ethnic cleansing and urged the administration to press harder for humanitarian access.\r\nRep.

                "description": "(5 Oct 2017) The State Department says Myanmar's crackdown that has caused an exodus of a half-million Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh could destabilize the region and invite international terrorists.\r\nPatrick Murphy, a senior U.S. official for Southeast Asia, says the U.S. has urged Myanmar's civilian and military officials to take action to stop the violence.\r\nHe told a congressional hearing Thursday that despite government assurances that security operations halted Sept. 5, vigilantes are still reportedly committing arson attacks on Rohingya homes and blocking humanitarian assistance.\r\nRep. Ed Royce, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described it as ethnic cleansing and urged the administration to press harder for humanitarian access.\r\nRep. Eliot Engel, the committee's top-ranking Democrat, said the U.S. should consider imposing targeted sanctions on Myanmar's military.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2c271d28f042493ef10467a0363c699b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
