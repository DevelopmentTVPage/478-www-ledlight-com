            "description": "(2 Aug 2017) DIANA'S FORMER BODYGUARD DEFENDS BRITISH DOCUMENTARY FEATURING PERSONAL RECORDINGS OF LATE PRINCESS\r\nPrincess Diana's former bodyguard has defended a new British documentary which contains recordings of the late Princess candidly discussing her personal life.\r\nFormer royal protection officer Ken Wharfe is a contributor to the film, \"Diana: In Her Own Words\" and provides a commentary on the recordings.  He worked for the Princess between 1986 and 1994.  \r\nSome royal watchers have called the program, to be broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday August 6, a betrayal of the late princess' privacy, but Wharfe disagrees.\r\n\"The only people that can say it's shocking are those that have not seen it.  I don't think it is shocking.  I really do not.  I would not have involved myself with a film that is shocking,\" he says.  \"I think it's very insightful.  I think it tells us something about Diana that, because we're seeing her for the first time, is actually delightful.\"\r\nChannel 4 said the video tapes, made in the early 1990s, are an \"important historical source\" and place Diana \"front and center\" in her own story as Britain marks 20 years since her unexpected death.\r\nWharfe also says he believes the Royal Family will watch the film.\r\n\"If you're under the impression that the Royal Family don't watch television or read papers or magazines, then you're fooled, because they do, and they will read it, and they will see it, and they will watch this documentary.  And what they'll see, and what William and Harry will see - they'll identify exactly what they said in their documentary less than a week ago, about a caring mother; somebody that was fun; someone that was entertaining; somebody that was a real good person to be with, because this is what this film tells us.\"\r\nThe channel said that although the recordings were made in private, \"the subjects covered are a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story.\"\r\nDiana Spencer married Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, in 1981 and the couple had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.  They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996, the year before Diana died in a car crash in Paris, aged 36.\r\nThe recordings of Diana talking to voice coach Peter Settelen were made at the princess' Kensington Palace residence, and include discussion of her failing marriage and Charles' relationship with his then-mistress Camilla Parker Bowles. Charles and Camilla went on to marry in 2005.\r\nRosa Monckton, a friend of Diana, said broadcasting the tapes was \"a betrayal of her privacy and of the family's privacy.\"\r\nFormer royal spokesman Dickie Arbiter told Sky News it was \"absolutely shameful\" that the tapes were being broadcast, saying Diana's family would find it \"very hurtful.\"\r\nBut Wharfe, who has written a book about his experiences with the Royal Family, says he believes Diana would have loved the documentary.\r\n\"I'll tell you what she would think: she would love it.  For the first time, she would say, 'Actually people now are actually listening to and hearing what I'm saying.'  That was part of the problem: you know, Diana had tried desperately throughout her troubled marriage to try and resolve the issues.\"\r\nSettelen made the recordings at a low point in Diana's life, after she had rocked the royal family by cooperating on a biography that went public with her unhappiness and the failure of her marriage.\r\nThe 20 videotapes were held by police after they were seized from ex-royal butler Paul Burrell's home in 2001 during an investigation of alleged theft from the late princess.\r\nPortions of the recordings were broadcast by U.S. network NBC in 2004, but they have never been shown in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/346e37cbb383586c95c78646037b841b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie welcomed United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to Buenos Aires on Wednesday.\r\nIt is the first time a British Cabinet minister visited Argentina for 16 years. \r\nHammond is on a four-day trip to South America. \r\nArgentina lost a brief but bloody war with Britain after Argentine troops invaded the South Atlantic archipelago in 1982. \r\nIn the biggest breakthrough in years, both countries recently announced that they would work to remove restrictions in the oil, fishing and shipping industries affecting the Falklands.\r\nThey also agreed to increase the number of flights between the islands and Argentina.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/9746bc7669af44a9f8778e99e91cc958 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(2 Aug 2017) More than a hundred buses carrying thousands of al-Qaida-linked fighters and Syrian refugees drove down a dirt road from Lebanon into Syria on Wednesday, in what was the last phase of an exchange deal between Syria's al-Qaida branch and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group.\r\nThe departure of al-Qaida fighters from the Lebanon-Syria border comes three years to the day after its fighters stormed the Lebanese border town of Arsal and captured two dozen soldiers, killing some in captivity and releasing others. \r\nThe group's presence in Lebanon has left scores of people dead.\r\nMore than 7,000 Syrian refugees and gunmen, including a top al-Qaida operative in Syria known as Abu Malek al-Talli, were aboard the 113 buses that left Lebanon's Arsal region toward the Syrian border village of Fleeta, according to the Syrian government-controlled Syrian Central Military Media.\r\nThe militants and civilians final destination will be Idlib, the jihadi-held part of northwestern Syria, according to an agreement between Lebanon, Syria, Hezbollah, and Syria's al-Qaida affiliate. \r\nThat group is known as the Hay'at Tahrir al Sham militant alliance - Arabic for the Levant Liberation Committee - or HTS.\r\nThe long line of buses drove through the partially paved mountain road between the two countries as Hezbollah fighters in beige uniforms and carrying Kalashnikov assault rifles watched them drive by. \r\nMasked gunmen could be seen inside the buses on the road that was decorated with Lebanese flags and yellow Hezbollah banners.\r\nHezbollah combatants have been fighting along Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces since 2013, and the Iran-backed group is still deeply involved in Syria's civil war, now in its seventh year.\r\nThe evacuation deal followed a military offensive by Hezbollah fighters and Syrian troops during which they captured border areas between the two countries and left hundreds of al-Qaida fighters besieged in a small rugged mountainous area.\r\nThe fighting ended with a cease-fire on July 27 for negotiations to allow refugees, fighters, and family members leave to Syria's northwest Idlib province and the central Qalamoun region.\r\nThe three Hezbollah fighters were released shortly after midnight Wednesday by HTS in return for the release of three al-Qaida fighters who were held in Lebanon.\r\nAs part of the deal, the two groups on Sunday exchanged the bodies of their dead fighters. \r\nHezbollah handed over the bodies of nine al-Qaida fighters in exchange for the bodies of five of its own.\r\nThe al-Qaida faction will release five more Hezbollah fighters it is holding in Syria once the convoy of buses arrives in Idlib.\r\nThe large number of Syrians who decided to return home shows that some refugees prefer to head back to their war-torn country rather than stay in tent settlements in Lebanon. \r\nThe tiny Arab country is home to about 1.2 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of Lebanon's population.\r\nThe U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a statement that it is not part of the agreement that led to the latest evacuations. \r\n\"UNHCR is not in a position to ascertain to what extent refugees, who are civilians by definition, are returning in this movement,\" UNHCR said.\r\nWith the departure of HTS fighters from Lebanon, the Lebanese army is expected to soon launch an offensive on territories controlled by members of the Islamic State group.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/517c69bd744e0a2be87cf5d229cdf06d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
