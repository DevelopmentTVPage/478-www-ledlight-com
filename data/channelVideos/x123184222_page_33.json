                "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Forecasters dialed back from their predictions of triple-digit heat across the Pacific Northwest, a region famous for cool weather where many people do not have air conditioning to help them endure the rare furnace-like blast.\r\nIn normally temperate Washington and Oregon, families generally get by on warm days by simply drawing shades and running fans.\r\nMany concerned communities have opened cooling centers and warned residents to stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity and keep their dogs out of parked vehicles.\r\nThe latest forecast for Seattle predicted highs easing a bit from earlier predictions. The National Weather Service said the high for Wednesday would be 91 degrees (32.8 Celsius) and 94 (34.4 Celsius) on Thursday.\r\nThe weather service also revised forecasts for Portland to match or break its record high of 107 degrees (41.7 Celsius). Meteorologist David Bishop said the city is now looking at 104 (40 degrees Celsius) or 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius) on Wednesday and Thursday.\r\n\"With little to no cloud cover at night, the higher temperatures kind of hang around a little bit,\" Bishop said. That creates a cycle in which \"the next day is going to be a little bit warmer because we're already starting off warmer than the previous day.\"\r\nThe Northwest is better known for its fall, winter and spring rainy seasons. Even July and August are relatively mild months. But the powerful high-pressure system arrived just at the height of summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b08b9a9b00807eed9098f6ad2628638a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Brazil's embattled President Michel Temer said on Wednesday that the decision taken by the lower house to not suspend him over bribery charges was \"a conquest for the democratic state of the law, the strength of the institutions and the constitution,\" instead of a personal victory. \r\nTemer, who survived the key congressional vote on Wednesday, mustered enough support to stay in office and avoid being tried by the country's highest court.\r\nHe spoke briefly to the journalists from the presidential palace, immediately after the last lawmaker voted calling on Brazilians to stay united. \r\nWhile Temer was clearly victorious, he won't likely have much time to celebrate. \r\nAttorney General Rodrigo Janot, who levelled the bribery charge against Temer, is expected to charge him with obstruction of justice by the end of the month. \r\nThat would provoke a second vote, forcing his allies to once again decide whether to risk their own political futures by sticking with the deeply unpopular leader. \r\nAll 513 seats in the chamber are up for election next year.\r\nTemer needed the support of just one-third of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies, or 171 members. \r\nHours after the voting began, he had received the votes of more than that number of legislators. \r\nIn the end, 263 deputies voted for the president and 227 voted against him.

                "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Brazil's embattled President Michel Temer said on Wednesday that the decision taken by the lower house to not suspend him over bribery charges was \"a conquest for the democratic state of the law, the strength of the institutions and the constitution,\" instead of a personal victory. \r\nTemer, who survived the key congressional vote on Wednesday, mustered enough support to stay in office and avoid being tried by the country's highest court.\r\nHe spoke briefly to the journalists from the presidential palace, immediately after the last lawmaker voted calling on Brazilians to stay united. \r\nWhile Temer was clearly victorious, he won't likely have much time to celebrate. \r\nAttorney General Rodrigo Janot, who levelled the bribery charge against Temer, is expected to charge him with obstruction of justice by the end of the month. \r\nThat would provoke a second vote, forcing his allies to once again decide whether to risk their own political futures by sticking with the deeply unpopular leader. \r\nAll 513 seats in the chamber are up for election next year.\r\nTemer needed the support of just one-third of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies, or 171 members. \r\nHours after the voting began, he had received the votes of more than that number of legislators. \r\nIn the end, 263 deputies voted for the president and 227 voted against him.

Instead, the family was faced with a society where single women were expected to be married off to IS fighters, and a raging battle in which all able-bodied men were compelled to report to the frontline.\r\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Nurshardrina Khairadhania, now 19, recalled her family's fateful decision to immigrate to the IS stronghold of Raqqa two years ago _ and how, only months later, their bid to escape began.\r\nDuring that time the family endured separation, her grandmother died after the arduous journey and an uncle was killed in an airstrike.\r\nShe now lives with her mother, two sisters, an aunt, three female cousins and their three young daughters in Ain Issa, a camp for the displaced run by the Kurdish forces fighting to expel IS from Raqqa. Her father and four surviving male cousins are in detention north of there. While the men are being interrogated by the Kurdish forces for possible links to IS, the women wait in a tent in the searing heat, hoping for the family to be reunited and return to their home in Jakarta.\r\nNur's family is among thousands from Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East who chased the dream of a new Islamic society advertised by IS in slickly produced propaganda videos, online blogs and other social media.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/18b5029243e3fb3ebfd928661b7cf785 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
