It's very sad,\" said Luiz Claudio da Silva.\r\nJane Nascimento, a former neighbour, had to move to a tiny social housing apartment, six miles away from Vila Autodromo. \r\nShe misses her garden, her dog and her old space. She lost her front teeth and much of her sight due to the stress in the process.\r\nNot all communities targeted for eviction lost their fight against City Hall. \r\nDespite being miles away from the Olympic venues, the northern shantytown of Indiana resisted attempts of being removed in order to make way for public squares and new buildings even though the city still managed to tear down five houses before it was forced to backtrack.\r\nCommunity leader Marcello Deodoro, who resides in Indiana, says his community can celebrate a small victory but cautions at potential challenges ahead. \r\n\"The truth is we won the first war, but we don't know which will be the next one that could come our way,\" Deodoro told the Associated Press.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e61b1bb29119ba4adaa54f37432bc499 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(5 Oct 2017) Tens of thousands of young immigrants have reapplied for the program protecting them from deportation, hoping this renewal won't be the last time they're able to stay in the country they've called home since childhood. \r\nMore than 112,000 renewals for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, had been sent to federal government as of Wednesday, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Thursday was the deadline for the 154,000 recipients eligible to reapply.\r\nThe rush of paperwork was prompted by the Trump's Administration's announcement in September that DACA would be phased out in March. Until then, the Trump Administration said Congress needed to address the issue of immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children.
