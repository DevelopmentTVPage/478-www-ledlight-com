So the equipment was no longer needed in manufacturing, it was passed to this shop, and everyone who wanted it, bought it. I bought such things there.\"\r\nWhen Basargin found out about the opening of the museum, he decided to make dozens of his collectibles a part of computer history, picking them up off the dusty shelves and donating them to Skynet.\r\nYear by year it becomes more difficult to find old Soviet computers - most people have thrown out old hardware.\r\n\"We have several dozens of Soviet computers here,\" says Martyanov. \r\n\"Actually, there were a lot of various computers produced in the Soviet Union, and the engineering industry kept pace with the times, striving to replicate and improve exhibits, so to improve those developments from abroad.\"\r\nWhile computers today can fit in the palm of our hands, those of the past were a much larger operation.\r\nMartyanov switches on an old computer and the whirring of the fan starts up.\r\n\"There were five of those fans in a single cupboard.
