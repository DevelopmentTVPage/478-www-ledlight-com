That's better than Apple's performance last year when its popular line of iPhone 7 phones came out.\r\nThe upbeat forecast is likely to ease concerns that production problems might delay the release of Apple's next-generation iPhone, which typically comes out in late September. That model is expected to boast a higher-quality screen and several other new features.\r\nIf the release of the next iPhone was going to be delayed until October or even later, analysts were expecting Apple to lower its revenue projections for the current quarter to below $45 billion.\r\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, declined to comment on the timing of the next iPhone during an interview with The Associated Press.\r\nBesides a bigger and better screen, the next iPhone is expected to include wireless charging and facial recognition technology to unlock the device, based on software coding that Apple mistakenly leaked.\r\nPeople are still snapping up the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that came out last September, according to Maestri. He said those models are the main reason Apple sold 41 million iPhones in the past quarter, a 2 percent uptick from last year.\r\nIn a long-awaited turnaround, Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the quarter, a 15 percent increase from last year. It's the first time Apple's quarterly sales of iPads have improved from the previous year since the opening three months of 2014.

His lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New York, lays out an explosive tale of Trump allies conspiring to push a false story to take the pressure of the Russian collusion investigation off the president, and a news organization willing to show the president its story before it was published.\r\nFox called the accusation that reporter Malia Zimmerman's story was published to detract from the Russian investigation \"completely erroneous.\" \r\nJay Wallace, Fox's news president, said the story is still being investigated and that Fox has no evidence that Wheeler was misquoted.\r\nThe White House had no immediate comment.\r\nWheeler, a Fox contributor who looked into Rich's July 2016 murder for the family, was brought into the case by Ed Butowsky, a Texas man and Trump supporter who appeared frequently on Fox, the lawsuit said. \r\nButowsky was intent on establishing a link between Rich, who was killed in July 2016 in what Washington police believe was a botched robbery, and the WikiLeaks scandal.\r\nWheeler was quoted in the May 16 story on Fox's web site saying there had been contact between Rich and WikiLeaks, whose dump of DNC emails proved a major detriment to Hillary Clinton's campaign. \r\nHe also said he was quoted falsely saying that someone - possibly Democrats or Clinton campaign officials - was blocking an investigation into Rich's murder.\r\nTwo days before the Fox article was published, Butowsky told Wheeler in a phone conversation that Trump had read the article and wanted it published immediately, the lawsuit said.\r\nButowsky had no immediate comment.\r\nWheeler also claimed that he was told that his false comments were put in the story because Trump wanted it that way. Wheeler also said that he and Butowsky had met with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and showed Spicer notes on Wheeler's investigation. Spicer asked to be kept informed of the probe, the lawsuit said.\r\nFox removed the story from its website a week after it was published, saying that \"it was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all of our reporting.\" That forced Fox News' most high-profile host, Sean Hannity, to back away from aggressively pushing the story on the air.\r\nWheeler, who is black and has been a Fox contributor since 2005, is also suing Fox for racial discrimination.

His lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New York, lays out an explosive tale of Trump allies conspiring to push a false story to take the pressure of the Russian collusion investigation off the president, and a news organization willing to show the president its story before it was published.\r\nFox called the accusation that reporter Malia Zimmerman's story was published to detract from the Russian investigation \"completely erroneous.\" \r\nJay Wallace, Fox's news president, said the story is still being investigated and that Fox has no evidence that Wheeler was misquoted.\r\nThe White House had no immediate comment.\r\nWheeler, a Fox contributor who looked into Rich's July 2016 murder for the family, was brought into the case by Ed Butowsky, a Texas man and Trump supporter who appeared frequently on Fox, the lawsuit said. \r\nButowsky was intent on establishing a link between Rich, who was killed in July 2016 in what Washington police believe was a botched robbery, and the WikiLeaks scandal.\r\nWheeler was quoted in the May 16 story on Fox's web site saying there had been contact between Rich and WikiLeaks, whose dump of DNC emails proved a major detriment to Hillary Clinton's campaign. \r\nHe also said he was quoted falsely saying that someone - possibly Democrats or Clinton campaign officials - was blocking an investigation into Rich's murder.\r\nTwo days before the Fox article was published, Butowsky told Wheeler in a phone conversation that Trump had read the article and wanted it published immediately, the lawsuit said.\r\nButowsky had no immediate comment.\r\nWheeler also claimed that he was told that his false comments were put in the story because Trump wanted it that way. Wheeler also said that he and Butowsky had met with former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and showed Spicer notes on Wheeler's investigation. Spicer asked to be kept informed of the probe, the lawsuit said.\r\nFox removed the story from its website a week after it was published, saying that \"it was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all of our reporting.\" That forced Fox News' most high-profile host, Sean Hannity, to back away from aggressively pushing the story on the air.\r\nWheeler, who is black and has been a Fox contributor since 2005, is also suing Fox for racial discrimination. He said similar law enforcement experts who are white were given higher pay and more opportunities.

Keep putting the weight on and your team mates will be dealt a penalty. \r\nAccording to the organisers, peer pressure and competition is a perfect weight loss combination.\r\nMost of the men who join aim to lose between five and ten per cent of their body fat.\r\nTerry Douding is project manager for ManVFat Football and he says the growth of the league shows they're on to a winning formula.\r\nHe says: \"I mean in the last eighteen months men all around the UK have been able to lose over thirty tons of weight and that is based on men losing one to two stone per season. Most of the men are loosing five per cent and many of them are losing ten per cent of their starting body weight and a lot of that comes down to the peer support from the other men and the coach. You know many of these men won't even be looking for new advice around nutrition, many of the men know what to do, but they need that accountability for change and turning up to a weekly weigh in with nineteen mates looking over their shoulder, knowing that it's the difference between winning, or losing the season, is usually enough for many of the men.\"\r\nWhen players join they fill in a detailed questionnaire which inquires about their goals and where they have failed in the past. \r\nDowding says: \"On week fourteen, from week nine in fact, we would begin encouraging clients to fill those surveys back in with those gradings we can get an idea of individuals's self improvement and in fact on the first pilot league, the first league that we piloted,  98 per cent of the league reported health improvements of some sort.\"\r\nEach team has a coach who will take details about their weight, health and diet before every match. The aim is for the men to play at least two matches each week. \r\nOrganisers say they already have sponsorship and support from some professional football teams.\r\nThe men who play here are supported by Leyton Orient a professional club based in east London.\r\nThe club ground is literally across the field.\r\nMan V Fat says the cost of joining is about twenty-five British pounds each month, which is on par with the cost of gym membership. \r\nIn some parts of the country membership is free, as the scheme is incorporated into facilities provided by local health authorities.\r\nMember Dave Worley says he's always had problems with his weight and when he left university and started working he had even less time to do exercise. \r\nMost of the men who come here say they enjoy football, but their weight makes it difficult to play in other leagues.\r\nPhilip Smith is the head of health and well being at the Leyton Orient Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3cf2fd058bfc3c95c1db6cf7a168193f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
