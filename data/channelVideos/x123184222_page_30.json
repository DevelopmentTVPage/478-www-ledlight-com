There's also a small cicada (insect), a micro-bacteria transmitting leafhopper. It adapts itself very well to the dryness and it becomes more numerous with very dry weather.\"\r\nThe problem is immediately obvious in this field at harvest season. \r\nThe once seamless rows of lavender are now separated by large holes, which are getting bigger as the lavender plants keep shrinking.\r\nAn even closer look reveals the weakened plants grow fewer flowers than healthier versions.  \r\n\"Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller plant ears. The ear is underdeveloped and is either missing or weakened, so so we have a lot fewer of the noble parts of the plant that are the source of the essential oil,\" says Chaisse. \r\nThe situation is made worse by a leafhopper insect that carries phytoplasma, a bacterial parasite that attacks the plant tissue. \r\n\"The leafhopper is responsible for directly transmitting the phytoplasma disease. This illness sets in on healthy plants, infects them and grows into the plant, in the sap, slowly causing its death,\" Chaisse explains. \r\nPlants affected by the condition turn a pale green or yellowish colour and produce smaller leaves with no flowers, says Chaisse. \r\nThe deterioration of lavender plants started with a series of dry weather spells between 2003 and 2007, he says. \r\nThe region enjoyed more rainfall from 2012 to 2014, but drought hit the lavender again last year. \r\nA lack of rainfall during the autumn of 2016 and this past spring further exacerbated the situation, leading to a higher plant mortality, says Chaisse. \r\nTypical of Mediterranean areas, lavender historically plays an important role in the economy of Provence, with almost 26,000 producers directly or indirectly involved in the lavender industry.\r\nThe region is also internationally renowned for its production of essential oils obtained from the distillation of lavender plants.\r\nJean-Marie Naud is a farmer producing Lavandula angustifolia and lavandin in the village of Eurre, in southeastern France. \r\nNaud started cultivating the plant 25 years ago. \r\nIn order to preserve its purity, he says, he's adopted traditional methods that include harvesting by hand. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f804c490591752ae7fce46c6af90c8e1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(2 Aug 2017) Princess Diana's former bodyguard has defended a new British documentary which contains recordings of the late Princess candidly discussing her personal life.\r\nFormer royal protection officer Ken Wharfe is a contributor to the film, \"Diana: In Her Own Words\" and provides a commentary on the recordings. \r\nHe worked for the Princess between 1986 and 1994.  \r\nSome royal watchers have called the programme, to be broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday, August 6, a betrayal of the late princess' privacy, but Wharfe disagrees.\r\nChannel 4 said the video tapes, made in the early 1990s, are an \"important historical source\" and place Diana \"front and centre\" in her own story as Britain marks 20 years since her unexpected death.\r\nWharfe also says he believes the Royal Family will watch the film.\r\nThe channel said that although the recordings were made in private, \"the subjects covered are a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story.\"\r\nDiana Spencer married Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, in 1981 and the couple had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.  \r\nThey separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996, the year before Diana died in a car crash in Paris, aged 36.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/027288fc901bb51145bd45c65839b6ef \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
