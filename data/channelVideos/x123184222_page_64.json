            "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Long lines at supermarkets in a hard hit seaside town in Puerto Rico's north-eastern coast attest to the desperation of residents from the damages caused by Hurricane Maria.\r\nIn Loiza, about 15 miles (24 kilometres) north of San Juan, residents are hoping to stock up on food and propane gas used for cooking. \r\n25 year-old Kelly Cirino, a mother of three with another baby on the way, trekked with children two days in a row to the Medinia Supermarket, trying to buy water to cook and make milk for the youngsters.\r\nShe says her electronic welfare card doesn't work because there is no electricity, and she has no cash, leaving her frustrated and despondent over how to resolve the impasse.\r\nResidents lined up at the Medinia Supermarket throughout the day Monday, buying propane gas for cooking and a few items allowed under imposed restrictions by the store manager, who is limiting purchases to ensure as many people as possible can be supplied by the store's diminishing stock.\r\nDavid Guzman, who manages the two Medinia Supermarkets in town, says he will continue to sell what he has until there is nothing left. \r\nBut, he says, after that there is no telling when his markets might be resupplied since he has no communications with suppliers. \r\nCritical medicines in the market's pharmacy are also being rationed, and the pharmacist says she has enough supplies to last for about 5 more days for the most vulnerable patients, those with diabetes and other chronic conditions. \r\nAfter that, she says, she has no idea when the pharmacy might receive a new shipment. \r\nFor the almost 30,000 people living in the town's shattered houses, simple survival will become increasingly difficult until critical food and medical supplies begin arriving, another challenge for the island's government as it grapples with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1003b2b9990e285b484207bb0048b42c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(25 Sep 2017) Long lines at supermarkets in a hard hit seaside town in Puerto Rico's north-eastern coast attest to the desperation of residents from the damages caused by Hurricane Maria.\r\nIn Loiza, about 15 miles (24 kilometres) north of San Juan, residents are hoping to stock up on food and propane gas used for cooking. \r\n25 year-old Kelly Cirino, a mother of three with another baby on the way, trekked with children two days in a row to the Medinia Supermarket, trying to buy water to cook and make milk for the youngsters.\r\nShe says her electronic welfare card doesn't work because there is no electricity, and she has no cash, leaving her frustrated and despondent over how to resolve the impasse.\r\nResidents lined up at the Medinia Supermarket throughout the day Monday, buying propane gas for cooking and a few items allowed under imposed restrictions by the store manager, who is limiting purchases to ensure as many people as possible can be supplied by the store's diminishing stock.\r\nDavid Guzman, who manages the two Medinia Supermarkets in town, says he will continue to sell what he has until there is nothing left. \r\nBut, he says, after that there is no telling when his markets might be resupplied since he has no communications with suppliers. \r\nCritical medicines in the market's pharmacy are also being rationed, and the pharmacist says she has enough supplies to last for about 5 more days for the most vulnerable patients, those with diabetes and other chronic conditions. \r\nAfter that, she says, she has no idea when the pharmacy might receive a new shipment. \r\nFor the almost 30,000 people living in the town's shattered houses, simple survival will become increasingly difficult until critical food and medical supplies begin arriving, another challenge for the island's government as it grapples with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1003b2b9990e285b484207bb0048b42c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The actor said that name of the baby will be determined by her grandparents, who are over the moon about their granddaughter's arrival.\r\nHong Kong's former most eligible bachelor, Kwok tied the knot earlier this year with a young model from China.  Rumors had swirled for months that the new Mrs. Kwok was expecting, but the newlyweds never confirmed the pregnancy news.  \r\nNow, thanks to his new bundle of joy, Kwok says he's a changed man.\r\n\"My friends don't see me out now.

            "description": "(26 Sep 2017) AARON KWOK GUSHES ABOUT BABY GIRL AT FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE AFTER BECOMING DAD\r\nIt's a girl for Hong Kong superstar Aaron Kwok and new wife, Moka Fang. \r\nThe 51 year old actor confirmed the gender of his newborn baby at a fashion event in Hong Kong, Tuesday (26 SEPT. 2017). \r\nKwok was making his first public appearance since announcing on social media last Friday that he had became a father.  \r\nThe \"Cold War\" star grinned from ear to ear as he talked about his new arrival. Calling his daughter his \"love from a past life,\" Kwok described how moved he was by her birth.\r\n\"The three of us were all crying.  If you didn't experience it yourself, you don't know what it's like.  When I saw the birth of this little life, I felt that the world has changed, completely changed.  It was such a moving moment.  This is life, you keep growing and keep learning\", Kwok gushed.\r\nKwok also revealed that the baby weighed 6 lbs at birth but did not disclose her birth date.  The actor said that name of the baby will be determined by her grandparents, who are over the moon about their granddaughter's arrival.\r\nHong Kong's former most eligible bachelor, Kwok tied the knot earlier this year with a young model from China.  Rumors had swirled for months that the new Mrs. Kwok was expecting, but the newlyweds never confirmed the pregnancy news.  \r\nNow, thanks to his new bundle of joy, Kwok says he's a changed man.\r\n\"My friends don't see me out now.   Basically when I have a day off, I'm at home, spending time with the family\u2026I feel like that's the responsibility of a dad.  You should take good care of your family and stay by their side.  That's the most important thing to me right now\", said Kwok.  \r\nThis is the first child for both Kwok and Fang.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/965dda771d6a70070d9adc3023b11807 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
