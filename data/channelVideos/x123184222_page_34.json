Paying outstanding debts for her father and uncle, finding work for the youngest men. And the biggest bonus: A chance to live in an Islamic society that was apparently on the ascendant.\r\nIt didn't take long before their dreams were crushed and their hopes for a better life destroyed as each of those promised benefits failed to materialize.

Honestly, I don't think there is any way to prepare for it,\" Akira Fukatsu, a 65-year-old retiree, said as he sat drinking a beer on a bench in a park overlooking a US Navy base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo. \r\nMany Japanese, South Koreans and Chinese appear to share that sense of resignation over North Korea's apparent newfound capacity to launch missiles capable of reaching much of the continental United States.\r\nThe 4 July firing of a Hwasong-14 ICBM, its first test, and another last weekend suggest that major US cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago are within range of North Korean weapons. \r\nSuch missiles could be armed with nuclear, biological or chemical warheads, although experts say North Korea hasn't mastered miniaturising them and might not have the technology to ensure a warhead would survive re-entry into the atmosphere from space or even hit an intended target.\r\nAttitudes in Japan, South Korea and China toward the threat vary, but likely reflect a sangfroid partly born of living with the legacy of the Cold War and ever present risks of huge earthquakes and other natural disasters.\r\n___\r\nJAPAN\r\nMany Japanese have mixed feelings about the latest developments, viewing them as a sign that by focusing on ICBM development, North Korea's aggression is directed toward the US rather than Japan, even if test launches have been splashing down off Japan's coast.\r\n\"Japan was within range of North Korean missiles even before their range extended recently,\" said Tetsuharu Nagashima, an official in charge of emergency response in Yokosuka, which is home to some of the 50,000 American troops stationed in US ally Japan, as well as a Japanese naval base.\r\nInstructions on the local government website tell people to take refuge in strong buildings or underground shopping arcades in case of attack, and to hit the ground and cover their heads if no such shelter is nearby.\r\nUnlike some communities that have held drills and drawn up contingency plans, Nagashima said Yokosuka had no plan to conduct evacuation drills.\r\nMisaki Honna, the mother of a 10-month-old girl, said suggestions that Yokosuka might be targeted because of the US and Japanese military presence were troubling.\r\n\"But even if we flee, we wouldn't know where to go. If a missile strikes, there's almost nothing you can do about it,\" she said.\r\nEiko Miyauchi, 83, endured US fire-bombings during World War II. As a child, she was evacuated from the coast and took shelter in an underground bunker as bombs rained down.\r\n\"I lived through the war, and I can't imagine anything being as scary as that one,\" she said.\r\n___\r\nSOUTH KOREA\r\nLiving just across the Demilitarized Zone from North Korea, South Koreans are famously laid back about its displays of military might.\r\nBut while life continues as usual and there's no visible panic on the streets, at least some South Koreans are starting to question whether North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles may have become bigger problems than anyone wants to admit.\r\n\"South Koreans have been too relaxed,\" said Yang Seung-jun, noting that missile launches show North Korea could attack the South at any time. \"It's our choice to laugh it off and say 'North Korea can't do that,' or the 'United Nations will sanction them'...

                "description": "(3 Aug 2017) North Korea's flurry of missile launches - 20 of them just in the past year - are a new and alarming fact of life for Japan and its other neighbours.\r\nBut Pyongyang's recent demonstrations of its capacity to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, while worrying, are drawing shrugs from many in the region who reckon there's not much anyone can do about them.\r\n\"We have no idea when and where (a missile) would strike. Honestly, I don't think there is any way to prepare for it,\" Akira Fukatsu, a 65-year-old retiree, said as he sat drinking a beer on a bench in a park overlooking a US Navy base in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo. \r\nMany Japanese, South Koreans and Chinese appear to share that sense of resignation over North Korea's apparent newfound capacity to launch missiles capable of reaching much of the continental United States.\r\nThe 4 July firing of a Hwasong-14 ICBM, its first test, and another last weekend suggest that major US cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago are within range of North Korean weapons. \r\nSuch missiles could be armed with nuclear, biological or chemical warheads, although experts say North Korea hasn't mastered miniaturising them and might not have the technology to ensure a warhead would survive re-entry into the atmosphere from space or even hit an intended target.\r\nAttitudes in Japan, South Korea and China toward the threat vary, but likely reflect a sangfroid partly born of living with the legacy of the Cold War and ever present risks of huge earthquakes and other natural disasters.\r\n___\r\nJAPAN\r\nMany Japanese have mixed feelings about the latest developments, viewing them as a sign that by focusing on ICBM development, North Korea's aggression is directed toward the US rather than Japan, even if test launches have been splashing down off Japan's coast.\r\n\"Japan was within range of North Korean missiles even before their range extended recently,\" said Tetsuharu Nagashima, an official in charge of emergency response in Yokosuka, which is home to some of the 50,000 American troops stationed in US ally Japan, as well as a Japanese naval base.\r\nInstructions on the local government website tell people to take refuge in strong buildings or underground shopping arcades in case of attack, and to hit the ground and cover their heads if no such shelter is nearby.\r\nUnlike some communities that have held drills and drawn up contingency plans, Nagashima said Yokosuka had no plan to conduct evacuation drills.\r\nMisaki Honna, the mother of a 10-month-old girl, said suggestions that Yokosuka might be targeted because of the US and Japanese military presence were troubling.\r\n\"But even if we flee, we wouldn't know where to go. If a missile strikes, there's almost nothing you can do about it,\" she said.\r\nEiko Miyauchi, 83, endured US fire-bombings during World War II. As a child, she was evacuated from the coast and took shelter in an underground bunker as bombs rained down.\r\n\"I lived through the war, and I can't imagine anything being as scary as that one,\" she said.\r\n___\r\nSOUTH KOREA\r\nLiving just across the Demilitarized Zone from North Korea, South Koreans are famously laid back about its displays of military might.\r\nBut while life continues as usual and there's no visible panic on the streets, at least some South Koreans are starting to question whether North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles may have become bigger problems than anyone wants to admit.\r\n\"South Koreans have been too relaxed,\" said Yang Seung-jun, noting that missile launches show North Korea could attack the South at any time. \"It's our choice to laugh it off and say 'North Korea can't do that,' or the 'United Nations will sanction them'... But war never happens when we expect it to,\" he said.\r\nStill, she does worry about the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3990ff84f9f7adabf957148be02b7010 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996, the year before Diana died in a car crash in Paris, aged 36.\r\nCharles married his longtime paramour Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005.\r\nIn the recordings, Diana also describes confronting her husband and Parker Bowles at a party - a moment Wharfe says marked \"the real beginning of the end\" of the royal marriage.\r\n\"She realized there was no chance of reconciliation,\" he said. \"There was only one direction, and that was divorce.\" \r\n\"This was the occasion of Camilla's sister's birthday and she and the Prince of Wales went to this party, which to me was slightly surprising, because Diana must have known this was going to be a difficult one, knowing that Camilla would be there, but that wasn't for me to say, I did my bit,\" he recalls.\r\n \"We eventually confronted Charles and Camilla, who were sat on a sofa talking somewhere else in the house. Diana, remarkably calm, said to Camilla, 'Look, don't treat me like an idiot, I know what's going on' and at that point, Camilla said something really strange, which I said in the film, never really understood it, she said 'It's ok for you, you've got two wonderful boys'. Now I knew at this particular point, any chance of any reconciliation here was seriously out of the question and as I say in the film, this was then the real beginning of the end.\"\r\nWharfe - who has a new book coming out on his time with the princess - says the documentary is a valuable reminder of Diana's role in \"the reshaping of the monarchy.\" \r\nHer death unleashed a public outpouring of grief in Britain and around the world. The royal family, whose stoic reserve suddenly seemed out of touch, has since softened its stiff upper lip. \r\nWilliam and Harry both campaign for more open discussion of mental health, and have spoken of their own struggles after their mother's death.\r\n\"They are picking up exactly where their mother left off,\" Wharfe said\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3d9dbd56aaf3f80c03aab18bbcc78514 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Charity workers say most of these deaths could have been prevented by teaching children basic swimming skills.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nOffering prayers at the graves of her two sons, Samela Begum says she will live with a life-long regret - she did not make sure her children knew how to swim.\r\nIn May, Begum lost both her sons - aged 14 and 21 and a nephew aged 17 - to a river near their grandfather's village not far from Dhaka.\r\nThe youngest boy fell into the water and the other two jumped in to save him \u2013 Begum says all three were swept away in the strong current.\r\n\"I have lost my sons, hope that no-one else faces such a situation,\" says a tearful Begum.\r\n\"Hope everyone teaches their children to swim. Hope all will give time to their children and never let the children go beyond their eyesight.\"\r\nDrowning is a major cause of death among youngsters in Bangladesh, claiming up to 18,000 children under the age of 18-years-old every year and 43 percent of deaths among children under five, according to a 2011 government survey. \r\nExperts say a majority of these deaths occur in natural water bodies, such as ponds and canals.\r\n\"Almost every household in the rural community, you can see there is a pond,\" says Aminur Rahman, a lead researcher with the Dhaka-based Center for Injury Prevention and Research.\r\n\"So there is wide exposure of water bodies for the children to be drowned, that's number one. \r\n\"Number two is lack of awareness, you know. People do not realise that these water(s) are so hazardous for the children to be drowned. \r\n\"And also lack of supervision, you know, is one of the main reasons for drowning and also there is lack of skills, like swimming skills, like first response skills.\"\r\nIn an effort to help mothers like Begum, a British charity has partnered with a Bangladeshi research group to offer swimming lessons in this central Bangladeshi farming village for children from poor, rural families. \r\nYoungsters once frightened to go near the water practice how to float in a makeshift swimming pool made of bamboo.\r\nThey're learning to swim in order to avoid becoming one of the 50 children who die each day in the hundreds of canals, rivers and streams crisscrossing the delta nation of Bangladesh. \r\n\"We often travel by the river route,\" says one young participant.\r\n\"If we fall in any kind of danger at that time, we would be able to save our lives by swimming.\"\r\nThe British charity - named 'The Sreepur Village, Bangladesh' after its flagship location - recently added swimming lessons to its overall program, aimed at offering commercial skills to some of the 142 single mothers and their 280 children recruited from across the South Asian nation. \r\nThe village was established in the 1980s by a British charity worker to help impoverished Bangladeshi women.\r\nIt's outfitted with modest concrete homes, playgrounds, a clinic and over 18 acres (eight hectares) of farmland. \r\nThe mothers and their children live at Sreepur Village for up to three years. \r\nThe program begins with smaller children spending a half-hour splashing around in a three-foot-deep swimming tank strewn with brightly coloured toys. \r\nA dozen other children wait nearby for their 30-minute turn, some of them jogging, stretching or doing light gymnastic exercises before diving in. \r\nNearby, in a natural pond, two instructors teach about six older children basic strokes and survival techniques. \r\n\"This is a drowning prevention program,\" says Matthew Silvester, a child development specialist from London, who works in the village. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8efdd5520b5fa5a4bbb4eaa078b7c6c2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
