                "description": "(26 Sep 2017) US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday there was a good tone during his trip to Beijing to meet Chinese officials in advance of President Donald Trump's visit later this year amid growing trade frictions.\r\nRoss was speaking at a conference in Hong Kong, where he arrived after a stop in Beijing as part of a three-nation Asian tour. \r\nWhile in Beijing, he met with Premier Li Keqiang, the country's top economic official, to prepare for Trump's visit and a senior trade mission led by Ross expected in November.\r\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Trump met when Xi visited the US in April.\r\nRoss said that while in Beijing he was organising things for Trump's visit in November.\r\n\"The tone, I felt, was pretty good,\" he said. \"But there's a lot of miles and a lot of negotiations between now and November.\"\r\nTrump has slammed China's large trade surpluses with the United States and threatened to hike tariffs on steel. \r\nHe has ordered an investigation into whether Beijing improperly pressures companies to hand over their technology in exchange for market access.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/305de10c98f003852474e9d0ec6fc641 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Convention organizer Andrew Moyes said they're also donating $5 each from 2,000 tickets sold online to Feeding Florida, a statewide network of food banks that are providing storm victims with food and emergency supplies. Between the auction and ticket sales, MegaCon Tampa Bay and fans should donate an estimated $20,000 for hurricane relief.\r\n\"We really felt that Florida was in need of that extra bit of magic,\" Moyes said. \"What better person to inject some inspiration and cheer than Stan Lee himself?\"\r\nLee wasn't originally scheduled to attend the Tampa event, but Moyes said they had worked with him previously for other conventions and knew Lee would be a great addition following the beating Florida took when Hurricane Irma made landfall on Sept. 10.\r\n\"He was on board right away to help out any way he can,\" Moyes said. \"That's just the type of person he is.\"\r\nWhile Lee is happy to help the storm victims, the 94-year-old said he gets the added enjoyment of meeting with fans and talking about comics.\r\n\"I keep saying, I've got to slow down somehow,\" Lee said. \"And then I hear that there's a new convention, and I can't resist. I've got to be in it.\"\r\nAfter more than half a century, Lee's affection for comics and the characters he helped create is as strong as ever.\r\n\"The thing that impresses me the most is the fact these characters have lasted, have lived this long, even without me writing them,\" Lee said. \"In fact, some of the writers now may be a hell of a lot better than I was. The characters live and thrive, and they're more popular than ever.
